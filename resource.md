# HackMysuru 1.0 — Phase 1 Submission Index

> **This is the landing file for your submission.** Reviewers open this file first.
> Every evaluation artifact is uploaded to **Google Drive** and linked below. No files in the repo, no other platforms.
> Freeze: **20 September 2026, 23:59 IST.** Anything not linked here before the freeze does not exist for judging.

<!--
HOW TO FILL THIS FILE
1. Replace every <placeholder>. Delete these HTML comments if you like (they don't render on GitHub).
2. Use a PERSONAL Gmail account for uploads. Many college Google Workspace accounts block
   "Anyone with the link" sharing outside the college domain, and reviewers will see "Request access".
3. Share each FILE (not a folder) as: General access → "Anyone with the link" → Viewer.
4. Test every link in an incognito/private window before the deadline.
5. Do not replace or re-upload a file after the freeze. Reviewers compare the SHA-256 below.

**Sub-problem:** `Follow-through, verification, and field-worker feedback loop`

**In one sentence:** `A Mysuru civic-complaint workflow that routes map-selected reports to allotted workers, records their action, and uses Before/After AI review to give citizens and MCC evidence of the outcome.`
